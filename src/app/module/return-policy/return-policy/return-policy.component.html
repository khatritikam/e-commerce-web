                            15 hours from the date of delivery of the product. Any return/exchange request after the
                            specified period will not be valid. Any unworn shoes can be exchanged due to incorrect size
                            or receipt of a defective item, and the customer will be provided with a replacement of the
                            item, free of any shipping charges. Once an exchange request is initiated, our delivery
                            representative will pick up the original item and will deliver the new item at a later date.
